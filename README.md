## Platform support

| Android | iOS | macOS | Windows | Linux | Web |
|:-------:|:---:|:-----:|:-------:|:-----:|:---:|
| Planned | Planned | Planned | Planned | Planned | Planned |

Background sync is implemented natively on every platform listed above (WorkManager on Android, BGTaskScheduler on iOS, system timers on desktop, ServiceWorker on Web).

## Roadmap and phase tracker

The package is delivered across 18 numbered phases. Each phase lives on its own branch and lands via a pull request to `develop`.

- [x] Phase 0 — Git and GitHub setup
- [x] Phase 1 — Foundation models and interfaces
- [x] Phase 2 — Hybrid Logical Clock and core engine internals
- [x] Phase 3 — CRDTs (GCounter, PNCounter, TwoPhaseSet, LWWSet, LWWMap, SyncText)
- [x] Phase 4 — Conflict resolvers (LWW, ServerWins, ClientWins, CRDT, FieldLevel)
- [ ] Phase 5 — Persistent outbox with exponential-backoff retry
- [ ] Phase 6 — Local store (Drift and Hive implementations)
- [ ] Phase 7 — Connectivity and bandwidth awareness
- [ ] Phase 8 — Scheduler and per-platform background sync
- [ ] Phase 9 — Backend adapters (Supabase, Firebase, REST, GraphQL, gRPC, Mock)
- [ ] Phase 10 — AES-256-GCM encryption at rest with Argon2id
- [ ] Phase 11 — Audit trail and structured logging
- [ ] Phase 12 — Schema migrations
- [ ] Phase 13 — Core engine and public API
- [ ] Phase 14 — In-app DevTools overlay
- [ ] Phase 15 — Tests (unit, behavioral, integration, property-based)
- [ ] Phase 16 — Example application (Todos and Notes)
- [ ] Phase 17 — Documentation

## Planned features

Items marked WIP are not yet implemented.

### Core engine
- WIP — Declarative entry point: `FlutterSync.configure(...)` and `flutterSync.repository<T>(...)`.
- WIP — Typed CRUD and reactive `watch` streams that always read from the local store.
- WIP — Optimistic local writes with background sync.
- WIP — Total event ordering via Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLC).
- WIP — Delta sync with `lastSyncedAt` advancement per collection.
- WIP — Pluggable conflict resolution at the global, per-collection, and per-field level.

### Outbox and delivery guarantees
- WIP — Persistent outbox that survives crashes, kills, and reboots.
- WIP — Exponential-backoff retry with jitter, dead-letter on permanent failure.
- WIP — SHA-256 idempotency keys for safe server-side deduplication.

### CRDTs
- WIP — `GCounter` (grow-only counter).
- WIP — `PNCounter` (positive-negative counter).
- WIP — `TwoPhaseSet`.
- WIP — `LWWSet<T>` (last-write-wins set).
- WIP — `LWWMap<K, V>` (last-write-wins map).
- WIP — `SyncText` (Logoot-based collaborative text).

### Backend adapters
- WIP — Supabase (Postgres + Realtime + RLS helpers).
- WIP — Firebase (Firestore).
- WIP — REST (JSON + pluggable auth).
- WIP — GraphQL (queries, mutations, subscriptions).
- WIP — gRPC (with shipped `.proto` service definition).
- WIP — Mock adapter for tests.

### Cross-platform background sync
- WIP — Android via `workmanager`.
- WIP — iOS via `BGTaskScheduler` + `background_fetch`.
- WIP — macOS, Windows, Linux via system timer + foreground detection.
- WIP — Web via `ServiceWorker` and `SharedWorker`.

### Security and operations
- WIP — AES-256-GCM encryption at rest, per-field opt-in.
- WIP — Argon2id key derivation with secure-storage-backed `KeyStore`.
- WIP — Bandwidth-aware adaptive batching.
- WIP — Queryable audit trail.
- WIP — Schema migration runner with ordered execution.
- WIP — In-app DevTools overlay with Status, Outbox, Conflicts, HLC, and Network tabs.

## Hybrid Logical Clock (HLC)

FlutterSync orders every event in the system through a Hybrid Logical Clock that follows Kulkarni et al. (2014), *"Logical Physical Clocks and Consistent Snapshots in Globally Distributed Databases."* Two devices that have never been online together can still agree on the order of any pair of events, even if their wall clocks drift by minutes or hours.

A timestamp is a `(physicalTime, logicalCounter, nodeId)` triple stored in the canonical wire form `{physicalMs}-{counter}-{nodeId}` — zero-padded so that the string sorts lexicographically. The implementation lives in `lib/src/core/hlc/` and exposes:

- `HLCTimestamp` — immutable value object with comparison operators and a `toWire()` / `parse()` round-trip.
- `HybridLogicalClock` — `tick()` for local events and `receive()` for remote events, with configurable drift tolerance (default 300 s, rejected drifts surface as `HLCDriftException`).
- `HLCNode` — interface for persisting the node identifier and the most recent clock snapshot, with an in-memory implementation suitable for tests.

## Delta sync and conflict merging

Pulls are incremental. Each collection carries a `lastSyncedAt` HLC watermark in `SyncMetadata`; only records strictly newer than that watermark are transferred.

The `DeltaComputer` reads the local store and returns the set of records that must be pushed to the backend. The `DeltaMerger` is the symmetric counterpart: it applies an incoming batch of remote records to the local store, advancing the local HLC on every receive and routing real collisions through the active `ConflictResolver`. The `BatchProcessor` groups individual writes into bounded-size, bounded-age batches that the scheduler hands to the adapter, while the `OptimisticUpdateManager` and `RollbackHandler` keep the local store consistent if a write permanently fails.

## CRDTs

FlutterSync ships six Conflict-free Replicated Data Types in `lib/src/crdt/`. Every type is proven associative, commutative, and idempotent (Phase 15 enforces this with property-based tests).

| Type | When to use it |
|---|---|
| `GCounter` | Monotonically-increasing counters (page views, likes, downloads). |
| `PNCounter` | Counters that need to support both increment and decrement (votes, balances). |
| `TwoPhaseSet<T>` | Sets where a removed element must stay removed (audit-style logs). |
| `LWWSet<T>` | Sets where removal can be undone by a fresher add (tags, labels). |
| `LWWMap<K, V>` | Key/value collections where each key's latest write wins by HLC. |
| `SyncText` | Collaborative text editing via a Logoot-based position model. |

Each type round-trips through `toJson` / `fromJson` so it can be serialized into a `SyncRecord` payload and synced like any other field.

## Conflict resolution

FlutterSync ships five built-in resolvers, plus a per-field combinator. Each is a thin implementation of the `ConflictResolver` interface and can be swapped at the global level (in `FlutterSync.configure`) or per repository (via `flutterSync.repository<T>(..., conflictResolver: ...)`).

| Resolver | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `LWWResolver` | The record with the strictly greater HLC wins. |
| `ServerWinsResolver` | The remote (server-issued) record always wins. |
| `ClientWinsResolver` | The local (device-issued) record always wins. |
| `CRDTResolver` | Each field listed in `mergers` is merged through a `CRDTFieldMerger`; other fields fall back to LWW. |
| `FieldLevelResolver` | Each field is resolved with its own configured strategy (LWW, ServerWins, ClientWins, or a custom merger). |

Custom resolvers implement `ConflictResolver` directly and may compose the built-ins as needed.

## Documentation

The full developer documentation lands in Phase 17 under `doc/`. Until then, the authoritative references are:

- `SUPERPROMPT_FLUTTERSYNC.md` — complete architectural blueprint and 18-phase execution plan.
- `CLAUDE.md` — Claude-specific operating manual.
- `AGENTS.md` — tool-agnostic agent guide following the agents.md open standard.
